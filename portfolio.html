            This is the program every developer learns when they start learning how to code. <br>
            Welcome to my portfolio Website :) <br>
            Here I display all my web development projects. I am a self-taught web developer
            and have just started in the web development world. My main motto for creating this website is
            to help people like me who are self-learners and are not from a CS background. Well, I am not 
            much of an experienced developer yet but I hope through this website I can bring a small change
            in the people's mindset that if I can do it, anyone can. I am eager to connect with other
            people like me and share ideas and projects. So, let's connect on LinkedIn.
            Before you go, feel free to explore the website and check my portfolio. I hope I can get some 
            good suggestions.
